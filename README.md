# Guitar Collection

### Have so many guitars you cant keep track of them all? This is the app for you!!!

## Set Up 
#### Fork and clone repo: https://github.com/dannyrooks/new-js-project
#### In the terminal switch directory to: $ 'cd new-js-project/backend'  then run: $ 'rails s' to start rails server. Next run: $ '..' and switch directory again this time to: $ 'cd new-js-project/frontend'  then run: $ 'open index.html' to see the working app in the (Chrome) browser.

#### Add brands then select that brand in the guitar form and fill in the specs. Now you can finally keep track of all those axes by opening all guitars or all brands, which will also list all the guitars with their proper brand!
